## Pre-commit 비판

[Pre-commit: Don’t git hooked! | Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/pre-commit-don-t-git-hooked)

[Cory House on X: "Pre-commit hooks are a waste of time. Why? Because they enforce standards too early. Pre-commit hooks make us wait for a quality check on every commit.👎 The code shouldn't need to be "right" to save my changes. The code only needs to be right before merge. Solution? Use CI." / X](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1612804261821259776)
