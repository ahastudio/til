## My Personal Mission

<https://www.facebook.com/notes/1054470145004848/>

> My mission: help geeks feels safe in the world. Everything I’ve done fits
> somehow:
>
> - **Patterns**. Isolate the repeating parts of problems and solutions so the
>   unique aspects come into clearer focus.
> - **xUnit**. Transmute worry into tests that replicate confidence.
> - **TDD**. Break overwhelming problems into a stream of
>   test-code-design-test-code-design. Extreme Programming. Create a rhythm and
>   structure for safe social interaction that results in solved problems (often
>   involving code).
> - **3X Explore/Expand/Extract**. Fit the punishment to the crime. Neither
>   over- nor under-do rigor, creativity, safety, planning, and reaction.
