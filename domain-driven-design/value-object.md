# Value Object

<https://wiki.c2.com/?ValueObject>

> Examples of value objects are things like numbers, dates, monies and strings.
> Usually, they are small objects which are used quite widely.
> Their identity is based on their state rather than on their object identity.
> This way, you can have multiple copies of the same conceptual value object.

> A small simple object, like money or a date range, whose equality isn't
> based on identity.

> One source of terminological confusion is that around the turn of the
> century some J2EE literature used "value object" for
> **Data Transfer Object**.
> That usage has mostly disappeared by now, but you might run into it.
