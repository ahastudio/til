## DDD Sample Application

> One of the most requested aids to coming up to speed on DDD
> has been a running example application. Starting from a simple set
> of functions and a model based on the cargo example used in
> Eric Evans' book, we have built a running application with which to
> demonstrate a practical implementation of the building block patterns
> as well as illustrate the impact of aggregates and bounded contexts.
