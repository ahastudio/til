Pick popular GeekNews articles and, for each one, write a TIL document in the
same format as the analyze-article skill.

## Usage

```text
/geeknews-hot
/geeknews-hot 3
```

- Argument: number of documents to write (default: 5)

## Procedure

### 1. Collect popular articles

Fetch https://news.hada.io/ with WebFetch.
Extract the list of articles ordered by points, highest first.
Collect each article's title, source URL, point count, and GeekNews topic URL.

### 2. Remove duplicates

Use Glob and Grep to search existing TIL documents and exclude any article
that already has a document on the same topic. Judge duplicates by title,
source URL, project name, etc.

After excluding duplicates, pick the requested number of articles by point
order.

### 3. Report the selection

Show the selected list of articles to the user. Format:

```text
1. Title (points) — expected path
2. Title (points) — expected path
...
```

If any articles were excluded, show them along with the reason.

### 4. Gather materials

For each selected article, in parallel:
- Fetch the source URL content with WebFetch.
- Fetch the body summary and comments of the GeekNews topic page with
  WebFetch.

### 5. Write the documents

For each selected article, invoke the `/analyze-article` skill with the
source URL, the chosen file path, and the GeekNews topic URL as arguments.

Additional context to pass when invoking:
- Include the fetched GeekNews comments so they can be reflected in the
  analysis or critique.
- Pass the GeekNews topic URL as the third argument so that references to
  GeekNews comments in the body are rendered as `[GeekNews 댓글](URL)`.
- Never recreate a document that already exists.

Create the file in a directory that matches the topic. Criteria for choosing
the directory:
- Refer to the existing TIL directory structure.
- Place it in the most appropriate existing directory.
- If there is no suitable existing directory, do NOT create a new one — ask
  the user.
