# Kafka Streams

> Kafka Streams is a client library for building applications and microservices,
> where the input and output data are stored in Kafka clusters.
> It combines the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications
> on the client side with the benefits of Kafka's server-side cluster technology.
